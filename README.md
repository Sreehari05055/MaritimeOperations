# Maritime Operations Fuel Efficiency Prediction

## Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict CO₂ emissions and fuel consumption for ships based on various factors such as distance traveled, weather conditions, and fuel type. Additionally, it integrates OpenAI's API to provide actionable insights based on the model's predictions.

## Features
- Predict CO₂ emissions based on ship type, fuel consumption, distance, and weather conditions.
- Predict the distance a ship can travel based on fuel consumption.
- Use OpenAI API to provide recommendations for optimizing fuel efficiency.
- Trained using the Random Forest Model.
